##BassPlugʟɪᴛᴇ

BassPlug Lite is intended to replace the annoying xhila autowoot script for Plug.DJ. BassPlug lite does not send adfly
links every time the user joins the booth, unlike xhila. It is also slightly more configurable due to the fact that 
there are buttons to toggle autojoin and autowoot.

Functions of BassPlugʟɪᴛᴇ -

BPL provides 2 simple functions for people who want a very lightweight script -

Function 1. Autowoot - Automatically woots a new song<br>
Function 2. Autojoin - Automatically joins the DJ booth or waitlist after your song is over.

Additionally, a !disable command is provided for room moderators which gives them the ability to turn of a user's autojoin.
